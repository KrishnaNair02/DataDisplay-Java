# DataDisplay-Java

This project, written in Java by me and Ethan Triggiano, takes a CSV file in of Covid-19 data and displays it as a graph to easily interpret the data. The user can choose specific regions to display data from, and can choose to sort the data alphabetically or by contraction rate based on race.
